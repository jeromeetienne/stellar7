virtualjoystick.js
==================

It is small library to emulate a virtual joystick for touchscreen.

How To Install It
=================

You can install it manually. Just do 

```html
<script src='virtualjoystick.js'></script>
```

You can install with [bower](http://bower.io/).

```bash
bower install virtualjoystick.js
```

then you add that in your html

```html
<script src="bower_components/virtualjoystick.js/virtualjoystick.js"></script>
```


How To Use It ?
===============

* ```opts.container``` is the
[dom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element)
on which we display joystick
* ```opts.stickElement``` is the
[dom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element)
which is display for the *stick* of the joystick.
* ```opts.baseElement``` is the 
[dom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element)
which is display for its *base*.
* Both elements are optional with sensible default
* you may set ```opts.mouseSupport``` to true during debug.
* you may set ```opts.stationaryBase``` to true for a permanent Stationary joystick base.
* if you do use a stationary base, you must also set ```opts.baseX``` to the desired X-coordinate on the webpage and ```opts.baseY``` to the desired Y-coordinate.  The joystick base will now be fixed at this location.
* you may set ```opts.limitStickTravel``` to true in order to limit the distance that the stick can travel from its base.  This will create an invisible circle barrier that the stick cannot leave. 
* if you do use ```opts.limitStickTravel``` , you can also set ```opts.stickRadius``` to the desired radius (in pixels).  The stick will now be confined to stickRadius.  If you do not set ```opts.stickRadius``` , it will default to 100 pixels radius.
